	<p>We adopted Belle when she was 10 months old from Beer Sheva local animal shelter.</p>
	<p>Before we took her she was in the shelter for four months, and before that she was a stray dog.</p>
	<p><span class="Font"> Belle </span> is <b> the best</b> dog in the world, There's <u>nothing</u> I don't love in her.
	<p> Although she might be bully with some new dogs, she's still the best.</p>
